What takes the most time is writing separately and turning it into a cohesive whole. Mosshart expounds, “If ‘Ash & Ice’ were a painting, it would be incredibly complex. It would be one that looked like it had been painted over and over and over and over. It would be so thick off the wall, it would be coming through the frame.”',

As the frontman of The Verve, Ashcroft was the signature voice of 1990s English pop music. The band’s global megahit “Bittersweet Symphony” – which Chris Martin famously called “the best song ever written, sung by the best singer in the world” – made them stars in the States and heroes at home. He’s played Saturday Night Live, graced the cover of Rolling Stone, been nominated for VMAs, GRAMMY’s, and The Mercury Prize but he’s never made a soul record with a hot shot hip-hop producer and venerated Motown greats, until now. In 2009, Ashcroft disbanded The Verve and focused on writing songs inspired by his love of soul, funk and gospel. The result is his first solo album in four years, United Nations Of Sound.',

Newman notes that, “At the beginning of this record, there was some thinking that we wanted it to be like a Krautrock Fifth Dimension. Of course, our mutated idea of what Krautrock is probably doesn’t sound like Krautrock at all. But we were thinking: Let’s try and rock in a different way.”\nSince their debut in 2000, The New Pornographers have released six studio albums including their most recent, Brill Bruisers, hailed as an “exuberant, synthpop-infused set” by Rolling Stone, “infectious” by Harper’s Bazaar and “the grand and purposeful hookfest that you would hope these guys would come back with” by Stereogum. Pitchfork went on to note that “with the futurist sound of Brill Bruisers, the whole band embraces a more electric version of itself— bulked-up in chrome-plated armor, firing on all cylinders, and ready to steamroll anything in its path.” The band celebrated the release with a special NPR Music “First Listen Live” concert at the legendary Brill Building, and performed songs from the album on both “Conan” and the “Late Show with David Letterman.”',

    artistSummary: 'The multi-dimensional, progressive-rock band,  announced today that they will be touring the US this spring, performing their landmark third album, “Good Apollo, I’m Burning Star IV: From Fear Through The Eyes of Madness”, in its entirety.\nGood Apollo, The epic 72-minute recording considered by most as the bands most progressive album, and including two of the band’s most known singles (Welcome Home and The Suffering) and selling over a million records worldwide. The band’s legion of fans grows every year, and the NEVERENDER concept now holds a special place within the culture of the Coheed community. NEVERENDER is the moniker given to these album performances by the band and it first started in 2008, when Coheed performed their first 4 albums over 4 nights – completing the feat in 4 different cities – New York, London, Chicago and Los Angeles. The band’s concept albums lend themselves particularly well to the live setting.\nSimultaneously, singer Claudio Sanchez announced on CBR.com (Comic Book Resources) his plans to release a 12-issue comic book for “Good Apollo” as part of his The Amory Wars series which comes this spring from Boom! Studios. The story, which loosely follows the lyrics of the album, centers around protagonist Claudio Kilgannon and the shocking discovery that he is The Crowing, a entity prophesied about in the holy book, who must dole out God’s judgment to destroy the universe.',

    artistSummary: 'SLIM CESSNA’S AUTO CLUB The Commandments According to SCAC\n\nIn September 2016, Slim Cessna\'s Auto Club is releasing its new album The Commandments According to SCAC. It has been twenty-four years since Slim Cessna parted ways with The Denver Gentlemen, that grand progenitor of the peculiar strain of Gothic Americana unique to the Mile High City, to form Slim Cessna\'s Auto Club with a group of talented peers. \nMany bands with a long and successful run like that would stick close to its roots. But rather than rest on well-earned laurels, the Auto Club challenged itself to break with well-worn modes of operating for the new record. \nWallace Stenger may have captured the spirit of the west in his 1971 novel Angle of Repose. Jim Thompson surely exposed the lurid underbelly of the Western experience. Cormac McCarthy definitely evoked the conflicted, tortured spirit of small town life on the frontier. William Faulkner and Flannery O\'Connor informed all of them with a humor and soulfulness. It is that literary tradition that imbues the harrowing and celebratory sound and riveting stories of Slim Cessna\'s Auto Club. And for a full twenty years it was largely in that realm of art that the Auto Club reveled and garnered a loyal cult following well beyond the boundaries of The Queen City of the Plains. \nBut no band can be satisfied with treading the same territory that it helped to define forever. The Commandments According to SCAC, will be the first full length album of original material released on the Auto Club\'s own imprint, SCACUNINCORPORATED. \nThe title evokes the themes of cosmic punishment and redemption that have served the band\'s songwriting engine so well in the past. But this set of songs sounds more hopeful and expansive, a quality that was always there but this time out the brighter sides of the songwriting are emphasized. Hints of this saw early full-flown expression on 2008\'s Cipher and Unentitled from 2011. \nWith The Commandments, however, the Auto Club seems to step forward into the promise of its own possibilities. It remains capable of the heady darkness and celebratory intensity with which it made its name. \nNow that charmingly dusky and spare sound breathes with a color and delicacy of feeling that perhaps sat in the background in times past. Maybe it\'s partly due to the greater creative contributions from longtime collaborator Rebecca Vera and The Peeler or the inclusion of upright bass player Ian O\'Dougherty. But the core of the band\'s songwriting and sound is anchored firmly in the vision of Slim, Munly Munly and Lord Dwight Pentacost. \nWhatever the true source of this transformation, The Commandments According to SCAC sounds like a band marshalling its creative inspiration to mark out a new chapter of its existence. When you get to see the Auto Club tour following the album\'s release, you\'ll get to see an already mighty band reinvigorated by this new spirit as well as by the fire that has long burned in its collective belly.',

    artistSummary: 'Kan Wakan is Gueorgui Linev, the producer, film composer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist whose critically acclaimed and Billboard-charting music dissolves the genre-breaking electronica of Massive Attack, Air, Bonobo and Zero 7 into a bottomless sea of 20th century minimalism, psychedelic soul and ambient atmosphere. The upcoming tour follows on the heels of Kan Wakan’s 2 new singles ahead of the new album, ‘I Would’ and ‘Molasses;’ both entering the Top 5 on Hype Machine charts and garnering significant airplay on BBC Radio 1 & 6, as well charting in the Top 10 on CMJ stations across the country. ‘Molasses’ in particular has sparked tremendous buzz, named “Today’s Top Tune” by KCRW, the track was synced on Oprah’s OWN Network show ‘Queen Sugar,’ aired Nov. 30th, and was licensed for a Dior Spring/Summer Ad. 2017 will mark a new chapter for the LA-based Bulgarian-born musician who was recently named in the LA Weekly as "one of the top 10 young songwriters in Los Angeles". Having produced and worked with the likes of Moses Sumney and Thundercat and scored his first feature film “Dead Draw”, it was time to incorporate a few collaborations of his own. With triple LP ‘Phantasmagoria’ soon on the way, Kan Wakan’s upcoming work incorporates guest vocalists and collaborations into an immersive melding of organic and electronic production mixed in with the orchestral flourishes of the Sofia Philharmonic orchestra. The upcoming new album is rounded out with Kan Wakan’s signature cinematic soundscapes that explore the space from where ‘Moving On’ left off.',

It’s there from the outset: the beefed-up beats of Certainty reveal an expanded sonic firmament, one in which bright synth hooks and insistent choruses circle around each other over chord sequences that strike just the right balance between nice and queasy. Shock-haired singer James says, “If there’s a sense of scale, it was really just a result of implementing a load of things that we didn’t know about the first time around.” Referring back to Sun Structures, a record that was recorded in his house in his native Kettering, James explains, “We didn’t even have a subwoofer to listen back to things that we did on Sun Structures, so there was nothing below 50Hz on Sun Structures. We didn’t even know those frequencies were there!” Co-founding member and bassist Thomas Warmsley describes a record in which “we discovered a lot as we went along, and the excitement at having done so radiates outwards.”',

He’d be playing new instruments, writing in unfamiliar new ways, opening himself up to an unrelenting stream of ideas and dedicating himself totally to pure musical instinct—and then releasing songs instantly to the public, without waiting to tour or assemble an album or anything. At the end of 2015, he’d walked into the studio with his guitar and a few lines of lyrics, hoping to sketch out a track or two just to stay busy, but that very first day he walked out with two finished songs and the inspiration to create something raw in real time, recording and releasing songs (and even videos!) direct to the public as soon as tape stopped rolling: “Everything was really as I did it,” he says.  “It was meant to be an experiment in how I could write and record and release something as quickly as possible. I didn’t wanna make an album—I wanted to put songs out every week. It’s personal for me.”',

    artistSummary: 'Zigaboo Modeliste and the New Aahkesstra\nJoseph “Zigaboo” Modeliste is a master drummer, rhythm innovator, percussionist, and New Orleans legend. The most highly-acclaimed drummer ever to hail from the Crescent City, Ziggy’s creativity has been a wellspring of funk influence for three decades, inspiring many Hip-Hop tracks. His innovative work as a member of the internationally acclaimed R&B group, The Meters, as well as his side work with artists like Keith Richards, Robert Palmer and Dr. John, have garnered him an unparalleled level of respect among musicians and fans. Ziggy’s style is unique. He is a master of creating funk grooves and new concepts for funk drumming. Zigaboo’s music consistently demonstrates his brilliance as the premier funk drummer of the contemporary era. \nThe original The Meters LP’s were all recorded with Ziggy at the drums, and his work has been sampled many times over by artists such as Musiq, Queen Latifah, Run DMC, NWA, Ice Cube, Salt N’ Pepa, Cypress Hill, EPMD, Public Enemy, A Tribe Called Quest, Beastie Boys, Naughty by Nature, and Tweet, just to name a few. Ziggy is a BMI award winner for the Young Gunz track, “Can’t Stop Won’t Stop.” His drum sound also provided the main loops for Amerie’s “1Thing,” which was nominated for two Grammy’s and was #1 on the R&B charts. \nZiggy has written over 200 songs individually and collectively with The Meters. His songwriting displays both his musical genius and original funk style. Zigaboo’s songs have been released on over 56 albums nationally and internationally. His tunes have also graced such movies as “Two Can Play That Game,” “Jackie Brown,” “Drum Line,” “8 Mile,” “Hancock,” “Red,” and a Nike Commercial for Footaction. Zig was featured in producer Mark Ronson’s 2011 Re:Generation Music Project, where he wrote and performed the original song “A La Modeliste,” with Erykah Badu, Mos Def, Trombone Shorty, and members of The Dap Kings. Zigaboo’s latest 2011 release, “New Life,” was praised as an amazing slide of funk—proof that Modeliste’s fountain of rhythmic imagination shows no signs of running dry. Ziggy’s first solo CD, “Zigaboo.com”, was released in 2000 and was reviewed as one of the most outstanding comeback records of the year. In 2004, the follow-up CD, “I’m on the Right Track,” featured special guests, Dr. John and Bernie Worrell. “Funk Me Hard Live” is a collection of funk originals recorded in 1980 and released in 2009. All these ever-grooving solo iconic albums were released on Zigaboo’s own label, JZM Records and are available for download from iTunes and on CD at Zigaboo.com and CDBaby.com. In 2013, Drum Channel and Zigaboo Modeliste released a DVD, ”The Originator of New Orleans Funky Drumming”—a history/biography of Zigaboo’s New Orleans Style Drumming approach and technique. Zig was honored with the cover story in the August, 2013, edition of Modern Drummer. He is also featured as he holds down the groove at Bonnaroo 2013 in the star-studded “Rock and Soul Dance Party,” singing his song, “Hey Pocky Away,” available on YouTube. \nIn 2014, Zigaboo’s drum work was sampled in Eminem’s award ( A Billboard # 1 BMI Award) winning single, “Berserk”, later that year Zigaboo along with his work with the Meters was showcased in Dave Grohl’s and HBO’s docuseries, “Sonic Highways”. \nOther accolades include being named one of the “Top 100 most Influential Drummers Ever” by Total Drumsets, Zigaboo’s legacy has also been immortalized in songs such as, “Ziggowatt” by Lettuce and “Zigaboogaloo” by Nicholas Payton. \nThe King of the Funky Drums, Percussion Maestro, and Godfather of Groove, Zigaboo Modeliste takes listeners to funk depths only he could possibly reach!',
